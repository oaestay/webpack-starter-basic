# Static site starter with Webpack v4

This is a project generated with the awesome [webpack-starter-basic](https://github.com/lifenautjoe/webpack-starter-basic) from [Joel Hernandez](http://www.lifenautjoe.com) (@lifenautjoe).

Created this repo just to bootstrap a deployable static site with ES6, SASS, etc.

# Setup
`npm i`
Also, don't forget to change the aliases in `now.json` :)

# Dev server
`npm run start`

# Build
`npm run build`

# Deploy (staging)
`now`

# Deploy
`now --target production`
